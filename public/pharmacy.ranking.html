<h1>Pharmacies that run 24/7 In Accra</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 24 hour Pharmacy</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Addpharma Ghana Limited</h3>
 <p>Of all the various branches of Addpharma, only the Movenpick branch runs 24 hours. This made it to my top 3 based on its proximity to the ridge hospital and their stock range. There is this saying among clients "If you do not get it at Addpharma, then you cannot get it anywhere."</p>
 <h3>Top Up Pharmacy</h3>
 <p>Three out of the numerous branches of Top Up run 24 hours. These branches are at East Legon, Spintex and Osu.This pharmacy is also well stocked with many medications</p>
<h3>East Cantonment Pharmacy</h3>
<p>The Circle and East Legon branches run the 24 hour service. They offer delivery services as well </p>
